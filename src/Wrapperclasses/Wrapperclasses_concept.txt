
A Wrapper Class is a class whose object wraps (or) contains a primitive datatype.
When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field we can store a primitive datatype.
In other words we can wrap primitive value into a wrapper class object.
Wrapper classes are used to convert primitive datatypes to objects and objects to primitive datatypes.
Wrapper Clases convert primitive datatypes into objects and this is needed on the internet for communication between 2 application.
Wrapper Classes are present in java.lang.*; package.

Datatypes		WrapperClasses
char		Character
byte		Byte
short		Short
long		Long
float		Float
double		Double
boolean		Boolean
int		Integer

AutoBoxing:
Converting a primitive datatype into it's object is called "autoboxing".
Integer obj=new Integer(504);

AutoUnBoxing:
Converting an object into it's corresponding primitive datatype is called "auto-unboxing".
			int i = obj.intValue();
