/*
 An enum is a data type. Enums can be thought of a classes with fixed set of constants.
  
  Points to remember for Enum:
  The enum constants are static and final implicitely.
  enum can have fields(non-static,static,final,static with final), constructors and methods.
  The enum can be defined within or outside the class because it is similar to a class.
  enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class.
  enums also used in constants
