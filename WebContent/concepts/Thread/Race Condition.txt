Race condition occurs in a multi-threaded environment when more than one thread try to access a shared resource (to modify, write) 
at the same time.
Examples of shared resources are class variables, database record in a table, writing in a file.

A code block that has a shared resource and may lead to race conditions is called a critical section.
Race conditions can be avoided by proper thread synchronization in critical sections.
