Synchronization:
In a multi-threaded environment when more than one threads are trying to access a shared resource(modify, write) we need to have some mechanism to ensure that the resource will be used only by one thread at a time. 
The process by which it is ensured is called synchronization.

In java to achieve synchronization we use concept called "Monitor".
Every object created in java is associated with monitor. Monitor is a also called as "Mutually Exclusive Lock"(mutex).
At any given time Only one thread can own the monitor.

Before any thread executes the code which is with in a synchronized method (or) synchronized block compiler provides instructions to acquire the lock on the specified object.

"synchronized" keyword is used for Synchronization in java.

We can use synchronized keyword for,
	Methods
	Blocks

We can use synchronized keyword  in four different ways.
	1) For a instance method 
	2) For a code block inside a instance method
	3) For static method 
	4) For a code block inside a static method
